<!-- Just getting repo set up and starting to pseudocode 
Weather dashboard:
GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs

WHEN I search for a city
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history

WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, and the wind speed

WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity

WHEN I click on a city in the search history
THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city

Top Header solid purple and name Weather Dashboard.
Body has two parts, on left 25% Column is a search area:
Text Box
Search Button
line break
Gray buttons for previous searched cities

Gotta create divs for these, decide where we max out with previous searches.  Hidden when there is none, shift down when too many?  This could be the toughest part.

NON-HTML NOTE - Dealing with the text input from misspelled cities might cause issues as well.  

Right 75& is as follows:

Outlined box a few rows deep tith city name, date, weather approprite icon then:
temp
wind
humidity

Under that box is a five day forecast with five equal cards:
date xx/xx/xxxx
icon
temp
wind
humidity

Saving the example under the images folder under 'mockup' for reference.

almost everything in this is dynamic besides headers and titles.

I think I can do the styling all in Bootstrap and hopefully don't even have a style.css.  This should be possible.

Need to figure out how this resizes on mobile with the side bar.  Maybe everything lines up vertically with the info box, followed by 5-day, then previous searches with the search box on bottom?  That's my initial idea, may pivot but that sounds good in my head.
