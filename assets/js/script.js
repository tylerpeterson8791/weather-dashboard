//Tons of dynamic stuff on this one. 
//Check api and see if date is necessary, if so use day.js to define current date.  Probably need this anyway for infobox display 
//Listener on search button as well as the previous search buttons
//
//Think about the buble up and how with the previous searches the variable will be autofilled as opposed to grabbing the textbox on a new one.
//
//^^^^Actually I want to set it up so the gray buttons automatically go when clicked so no need for the second click of the search.
//
// Previous search buttons should only appear if there's previous searches.  The example shows 8 slots, that should be sufficient.  Once the user reaches 8 previous searches, how do we handle "bumping" the newest one in for the oldest???  Think on that but start build as static
//
//Everything else should just be point and go from the API as far as the info we pop into divs
//
//Does the API need to be provided with the current date?
//
//How does it handle a misspelled city name?  
//
//If there's an error do we pop an alert?  Send them to a different page explaining error?
//
//I'm gonna check out the API and play with this and think about how I excecute.  Then come up with a skeleton tonight after the kid's bedtime.
